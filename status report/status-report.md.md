## *Prediction of overall survival times for breast cancer from H&E stained whole slide biopsy* 
#### *Anirbit Ghosh* 
#### *2439281g* 

## Proposal
### Motivation
*[state motivation for project]*

### Aims
The aim of this project is to use  CNN models and Cox Hazard Model ideas that were used in the original paper for colorectal cancer, and apply them to Breast Cancer using the DeepMed tiled dataset.

## Progress
* Read paper "Deep neural network models for computational histopathology: A survey" to learn about various DL techniques used in histopathology for various tasks and how it translates to survival prediction

* Read DL MSc course material - Week 1, week 2

* Complete DL MSc Lab - Week 1 : Blitz Pytorch tutorial, Tensor tutorial

* Create Github repo for project
