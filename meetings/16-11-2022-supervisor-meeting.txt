minutes:
- Show scores from Resnet model, discuss poorer performance
- Due to lack of data, lower training epochs and also image size incompatible. Better to stick to my own network, better for dissertation too
- Agree to train own network with full data set next and fine tune for better accuracy 
- Discuss clinical data again, as percentage values did not resemble a good represetation of tumor severity in correlation to survival time data
- Cox model is a very strong model, should still be able to produce reasonable results with only one feature if I just use tumour severity and no other features
- Investigate other features to extract - TIL (tumour infiltrating lymphocyte count), NTL (nucleus, tumour, lymphocyte data), tumour area and physical dimensions
- Then add clinical data if image features are not enough
- Use lifeline package for CH model and KM plots. 
- Discuss results from predicted tiles on high and low survival time WSI images, should be better with more training on network. But good to go ahead and use for 
survival models: "These look good ... the only worry I would have is that it may also be predicting always malignant for normal tissue (although the green around the 
edges suggest that it can predict non-malignant and I presume it also does this for the the PCam tiles that are normal ... although TCGA seems to be of a different 
nature than PCam). It would be nice to have a "TCGA negative control WSI" which you would hope it would colour mostly green ... but possibly all the samples in TCGA 
are positive cancers ... I'm not sure if there are any negative controls (although often in resections the surgeon does take a border of negative tissue around the
positive tumour to ensure they have all the tumour tissue)".
- Set up supervisor computer to help run slide tiling and model prediction pipeline. Agree to train on my own pc as GPU is good enough for training but IO actions
are slow
- Upload requirements.txt for anaconda to setup environment with all dependencies. Run into compatibility issues between windows pacakges vs Linux support
- Upload anaconda environment.yml files to get OS independent dependencies list. 
- supervisor computer setup successfully
