Minutes:
Supervisor meeting - Show hyperparam tuning, agree its good and is sufficient since it agrees with my original model. Discuss plan for evaluation - Aim to complete classification evaluation by next week. Classification evaluation to contain hyperparam tuning results and calculate metrics (acc, precision, recall) for classified predictions and plot confusion matrix. Regression evaluation plan - 1. Discuss significance of derived scores as covariates with confidence interval plot. 2. For each model, plot predicted median survival against actual survival time to show if any relationship can be derived between the two. 3. Perform 5 fold cross validation to calculate RMSE scores for each model, plot SD and mean RMSE as distribution curves to show how predictions will be distributed.
