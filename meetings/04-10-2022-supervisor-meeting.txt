are there correctly labelled data for segments of WSI? 
A: camelyon - go from low res to high res image  to generate bespoke data - breast lymph node biopsy

Where is the data to use to train?
A: TCGA 

Survival of colorectal cancer paper : read for segmentation


NOTE: cancer cells - larger cell nuclei - boundary of tumours immune cell invasion - recognize abnormal tissue and attack tumor boundary - 
immune signal can be a measure of survival time

where is the 100k data from?
A: number of german hospitals - independent sample - retrieved from NCT Heidelberg Germany (archived samples). WSI were from TCGA database.

IS TCGA Data annotated for parts of tissue?
A: No annotated with clinical data - survival time, cancer grade etc

NOTE: Potentially could use other cancer's WSI data as msucle, adipose, lymphocytes etc are common tissues across all samples. Determining their
weights in predicting survival time is necessary as they dont effect it

TCGA data is all cancerous tumour sections - look into data size of WSI - image size

Logistics of working on GPU:
locally or network based - 

NOTE: Having to Tile WSI TCGA data is a big challenge resource wise - 

TCGA Clinical Data - download text file - 


dissertation - doesnt have to work - work within capabilities of our resources - cannot process 100k data of course - write something 
substantial even if it doesnt work

camelyon16 data can be used - 600gb of data downloading not possible - github tiled camelyon might be available - https://github.com/basveeling/pcam
Patch Camelyon data can be used - split into train test splits - 96x96 tiles - 50/50 balance between positive and negative samples

take data from 100k dataset camelyon dataset and apply into TCGA dataset for breast cancer - possible 

is it possible to tile wsi ourselves?
A: yes OpenSlide 

https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/38/14/3629/6604265?rss=1#366188933 - similar project

tcga -repo - filter by file size and use smaller files and try out tiling, segmentation using openslide

reason nn might perform worse - its random and chaotic - can be made deterministic 

TASK FOR NEXT WEEK:
- Read CRC histopathology paper 
- Try to download some Whole Slide data from TCGA, and investigate their average size + storage Logistics
- Investigate Whole Slide image tiling with OpenSlide
