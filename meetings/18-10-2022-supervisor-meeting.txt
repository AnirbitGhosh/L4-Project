Progress made and points to discuss:

- Extracted full PCAM dataset for training, validation and testing of tumour segmentation task
- Stored dataset in external HDD
- Extracted images from HDF5 format into data folder hierarchy
- Created custom PyTorch dataset class to hold an image + its label from metadata.csv files provided with PCAM
- Use created dataset to embed training images and visualize inline using VSCode interactive mode
- Watch several Deep Learning videos on Camelyon Challenge and Cancer detection from slide images, mostly using Keras and TensorFlow. Not much
PyTorch resources online. 
- Choose to work locally on local GPU, instead of Google Collab as storing data locally is more robust.
- Normalization doesn't work as eignevectors dont converge on PCAM data images
- Are PCAM images pre-normalized? can be used directly in training? 
- May have to normalize TCGA tiles before feeding to CNN for label prediction?
