Progress made and points to discuss: 
- Had less time as an essay is due, with a group presentation and other coursework
- Created custom CNN with 2 FC layers to take as input 96x96 tiles
- Trained the Network with 1000 PCAM images 
- used an ADAM optimizer, with a NLLLoss function to achieve a 78% accuracy with PCAM validation data
- Saved the state_dict of the trained model to use for inference
- loaded the saved state_dict into a model, transformed images with the required transforms and converted into [3,96,96] tensors to use as input
- Pass TCGA WSI tiles (96x96px) as input to the Network
- obtain a list of binary outputs, 1 - MALIGNANT or 0 - BENIGN
- Plot a subset of the images with a color map based on their predicted labels

Minutes:
- Discussed transfer learning of Resnet18
- Show the internal structure of Resnet18
- Discuss image size concern of training a Resnet18 model with anything besides 224x224 images
- Potential application of PCAM data to other breast cancer
- Look at CBioPortal to understand the clinical data available
- Discuss what KM plot is
- CBioPortal data has overall survival time for patients in months
- Use survival times of patients that are deceased as labels along with other clinical data columns as features to create a model to predict survival time
- Way to include the image analysis results into survival analysis
- Task for next week is to train transfer learning and visualize results of neural net predictions on whole slide image
