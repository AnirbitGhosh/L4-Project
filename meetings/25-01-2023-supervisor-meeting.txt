Minutes:
Discuss how to fit Design and implementation sections into project. Agree it is a bit inappropriate for research based projects. Discuss making extensions to project to try and get content to be included in implementation. Agree to not make major extensions this late. Discuss survival results including clinical data like Age, Sex etc as extensions - defeats the purpose of not using clinical data and testing the ability of histopathological images to characterize survival prognoses. Discuss including Hyperparameter optimization under implementation section. Agree to complete design section in the coming week and start on implementation next week.
