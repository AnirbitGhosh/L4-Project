- Show problems with Resnet training time, agree to train with less data and see how predictions look like on smaller dataset
- Explain KM plot and Cox models. 
- Study : https://medium.com/the-researchers-guide/survival-analysis-in-python-km-estimate-cox-ph-and-aft-model-5533843c5d5d, paper on python 
survival analysis. 
- Check out Lifelines library that gives ready-to-use KaplanmeierFitter and CoxPHFitter
- Discuss clinical data usage in developing survival model - Clinical data should be secondary as main goal is to quantify slide images to survival prediciton
- Agree to try initial survival model using only image features, an initial feature could be percentage of positive tiles as a score to quantify severity
- Come up with other ideas for image features
- Check validity of using percentage of positive tiles as a quantifier. Download WSI for two different patients, using the KM plot data from CBioPortal to 
represent two extreme ends of the survival spectrum and see if the current model generates a good score that would be expected. 
- Low survival time -> higher score (more positive tiles, more severe tumour) vs High survival time -> lower score
