Minutes: 
- Discussed results of predictions generated - seems good, with enough variance in positive and negative tiles to be considered valid 
However, no annotated data to verify. Look into potential cam17 data to use our network to predict and see if it matches ground truth tumor predictions
- Discussed TanH vs ReLU 
- Setup environment and openslide and run tiling script of 20 WSI from TCGA.
- Run Prediction on those 20 WSI tiles and save results in CSV and visualized prediction masks
- The results are of good resolution due to the size of the images and number of tiles. However, there seem to some issues with some slides being almost entirely positive
with negatives around the edges or scattered sparsely in the interior
- difficult to really conclusively say if this is accurate predictions over the WSI without some manual annotation done by a pathologist ... 
some predictions do seem to have "regions of tumour" predicted and also "regions of normal tissue" ... 
although the normal tissue is mostly where there are "edges" or "broken up tissue with background showing" ... 
difficult to really conclusively say whether this model is doing good regional WSI predictions or  not without annotated WSI unfortunately ... 
but I guess if the model is predictive of OS then it would suggest it is being reasonably accurate in terms of tile predictions for TCGA 
(i.e. it is generalizating from Camelyon tiles onto TCGA tiles) ... I guess a good check might be to use Camelyon 16/17 WSI with clear regions of 
normal tissue / tumour tissue ... like the annotated WSI shown on the web site of Camelyon 17 site
- This would give a strong idea that it is doing regional predictions of WSI (and level of FP, FN predictions within these regions) ... would just build 
confidence in terms of the model (although cross-validated accuracies on PCam already should indicate how accurate the model is).
- be interesting to see if these tile numbers / proportions are predictive for OS or some other slide-level WSI diagnostic / prognositic
- I certainly think it would be ok to take this model further. (I think if it was predicting all tiles as +ve or all tiles -ve ... a bit like Binghao's predictions for external datasets ... 
then this would be an issue ... but it does seem quite 'balanced' in predicting a good number of tiles +ve and a good number -ve on the TCGA WSI dataset.)
- Look into BRCA data to find annotated WSI samples - https://zenodo.org/record/5320076#.Y4olBTPP0UE - Contains some annotated slides from TCGA BRCA
- Annotations of this are pathologist approved. So can used to validate model visually comparing results. However, annotations in the BRCA.zip file are in a csv format of
x and y coordinates which are used to annotate slides in qupath. 
- Look into ways of using QUPath and visualize these annotations. 
- Same issue with CAM17 data, annotations are in a hard to access format requiring a lot of coding or specialized software to actually be able to see the annotated slides
