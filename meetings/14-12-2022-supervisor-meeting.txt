Minutes:
- Analyse each WSI heatmap to evaluate probability predictions over previous implementation of binary predictions: Much better results,
with clear regions of high darkness indicating realistic tumour predictions. 
- Slide containing clinical annotation (pen marks circling tumour region) seems to adhere to the generated predictions as the dark regions are enclosed within
the pen marked circle and all tissue outside the marked region is predicted as non-malignant. 
- Some tissues show unexpected predictions on the heatmap - slides with clearly distinct regions of different tissue types, the area predicted as non-malignant
is smoother and more consistent whereas area predicted as malignant is more noisy and irregular. Inspected original WSI of these slides to see that there are 
very different tissue types in these regions. The malignant region seems to be the breast tissue with a lot of debris and intersparsed fatty tissue whereas the negative
regions are continuous regions of muscle/non-breast tissue causing smoother and more consistent non-malignant prediction in those areas. 
- Analyse heatmaps of CAM17 data with annotations to verify validity. Predictions seem consistent with annotations with dark tiles in the regions expected to be malignant, 
and also more regions that are not annotated - could be due to the fact that CAM17 data did not fully annotate all cancer regions in a given slide and only identified a single region
that matched its definition of "positive" malignancy which is a 32x32px region with at least one cancer positive cell in it. 
- Discuss survival modelling : Features to be extracted can be malignancy score thresholded at a higher probability instead of 0.5 like the binary model did.
Thresholding at a higher probability like 0.7 will only consider the tiles most likely to be malignant in counting the number of malignant tiles as a percentage of
total tiles. This will give a more representative malignancy score for a given tissue sample. Using 0.5 threshold like the binary model, overpredicted malignancy 
which could have skewed survival models by assigning inflated malignancy scores to patients. This is a tile level feature giving a much more fine grained feature to 
exactly quantify the precise malignant regions in a tissue
- Another feature that can be used is the mean intensity of the heatmaps generated. The heatmaps use a continuous colour map mapping probability values between 0 and 1 to a colour.
Values closer to 0 being lighter and higher probability (closer to 1) being darker. This feature is a tissue level feature quantifying the overall malignancy of the sample. 
A higher mean intensity of the tissue (across all tiles) will indicate a much darker heatmap, indicating an overall more malignant sample with more regions of high malignancy likelihoods. 
Whereas a lower mean intensity indicates a lighter heatmap with more regions of low malignancy likelihoods which represents an overall less malignant tissue sample.
- Use two features for survival modelling - Malignancy score and Mean intensity and generate KM plots to see which is more reasonable. 
- Discuss status report - End of sem status report to be emailed to supervisor. Reach agreement that coding part of the project can be considered done and can start working on 
dissertation writing. While writing dissertation background and scientific analysis, certain concepts might come to light that can be implemented to the existing code to improve 
prediction model or feature extraction for survival. Set target of first draft by end of january. 
- Agree to send results of survival model using new features and probability prediction model by end of the week and conclude working for the upcoming week until christmas.
